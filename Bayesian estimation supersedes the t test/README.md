Bayesian estimation supersedes the t test.

*Abstract*: Bayesian estimation for two groups provides complete distributions of credible values for the effect size, group means and their difference, standard deviations and their difference, and the normality of the data. The method handles outliers. The decision rule can accept the null value (unlike traditional *t* tests) when certainty in the estimate is high (unlike Bayesian model comparison using Bayes factors). The method also yields precise estimates of statistical power for various research goals. The software and programs are free, and run on Macintosh, Linux, and Windows platforms.

*New (Sept. 3, 2012):* The programs now include a version for estimating the parameters of a single group. The 1-group version is named BEST1G.R. See the example in BEST1Gexample.R and [this blog post](http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/2012/09/one-group-version-of-best-bayesian.html).
